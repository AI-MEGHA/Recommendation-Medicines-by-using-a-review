# Recommendation-Medicines-by-using-a-review
 Recommendation Medicines : Using a review that fit the patient's condition. The process proceeds in the order of data exploration - data preprocessing - model - conclusion - limit. In the data exploration part, we will look at data types with visualization techniques and statistical techniques. Through this process, we can set the topic, preprocess the data to fit the objective, and create various variables to fit model. At the model part, emotion analysis using word dictionary, n-gram applying deep learning, etc. were used. In order to compensate the limitation of natural language processing, Lightgbm machine learning model was used and reliability was further secured through usefulcount. Finally, I will introduce the limitations and weak points of conclusion and analysis of the project.
